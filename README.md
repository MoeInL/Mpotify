# Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a desktop application that runs on Windows Forms and closely resembles the Spotify interface. The application will have the ability to play any song provided by the user and display the user's songs for browsing. It should support multiple users, allowing them to sign up for new accounts and log in later using their email and password.

# Tools Used

  <ul>
      <li>C#</li>
      <li>Visual Studio</li> 
      <li>Windows Forms</li>       
  </ul>


# Goals

By working on this project, I will have the opportunity to apply the knowledge I gained from my university course, "Object-Oriented Design." The key concepts I learned from the course include the following:
  <ul>
      <li>Code in C#</li>
      <li>How to use Visual Studio's Windows Forms.</li>
      <li>How to apply the SOLID Principle.</li>        
      <li>How to apply the Gang Of Four Patterns.</li>
  </ul>

In addition to that, i will be getting a chance to experience what it's like to:

<ul>
    <li>Build a desktop application.</li>
    <li>Getting started in learning how to write clean and maintainable code.</li>
    <li>Delivering a meaningfull working application with usefull features.</li>
</ul>
